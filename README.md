# Do you want to have a custom description of your GitHub profile? 

Here is how to do it:

1. Create a new repo and give it a name exactly as your username is. For example, my username is `gk3000`, I would create a repo and name it `gk3000`. 
2. In this repo creater a file `readme.md` 
3. Using markdown add any content into this file. 
4. That's it! 

Here is a link to the markdown reference: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

Now when someone will go to you GitHub profile they will see the content of this file properly rendered with all sorts of content like images, links, emojis, etc...
